# unreal-cpp-project
Project made alongside Udemy course. I am currently familar with the Unity and C# game engine and have started to expand my horizons starting to learn Unreal Engine 4 and C++. 

Guess the isogram (any word that doesn’t have any repeating letters)
Letter in guess and right place is a “Bull”
Letter in guess but wrong place is a “Cow”

**Mechanics**
- A hidden word from a list of words
- The game will let us know lives
- Player will make a guess
- Lose life if the wrong
- Display how many bulls/cows you have
- If the lives run out, the game is over

This project has given me my stepping stone into the world of Unreal and C++ and I am continuing the course to expand my knowledge and create my own games.
